# List what the library could put on the stack: its local arrays with
# explicit bounds that aren't constants (automatic arrays), and the array
# temporaries the compiler creates for its expressions (gfortran's
# -Warray-temporaries). Some compilers and flags (gfortran -fstack-arrays or
# -Ofast, the Intel compilers without -heap-arrays) put both on the stack,
# which a large problem then overflows; the library's rule is to have neither
# sized by the problem (see CLAUDE.md, "Ground rules").
#
# usage (from the repository root):
#
#    pixi run tools/stack_check.sh
#
# The automatic arrays must be none: the script fails if there is one. The
# temporaries are listed for review. The ones left are small, or are not on
# the stack: a one-element constructor (`[f]`), the filter's entries, the
# reduced Hessian of at most `dense_max_ns` superbasics, the low-rank update
# of the KKT matrix (twice the L-BFGS memory), the results of the functions
# of the printed summary (allocatable, so on the heap), the copy of an
# argument that may not be contiguous (`lsqr%solve(out, ...)`: made by the
# run-time library, on the heap, and only if it isn't), and the dense QP
# solver and its linear algebra (`sqpopt_qp_dense_module`,
# `sqpopt_dense_linalg_module`, `hessian_dense`), whose matrices are dense
# anyway.
